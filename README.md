# Deep Learning for K3 Fibrations

Repository for the software and results from "Deep Learning for K3 Fibrations in Heterotic/Type IIA String Duality"

## Installation

Below is the list of libraries that are needed to execute the Jupyter Notebook:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
keras
keras-tuner

You can install the above libraries using pip:

`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras keras-tuner`

In case you prefer using Conda, you can do:

`conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras keras-tuner`

Once you have a clone of the repo and the prerequisites installed, you should be able to open the Jupyter Notebook and start exploring!
